# [Project 2: Data Visualization](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dandersonghub/Data-Visualization/blob/main/Data_Visualization.ipynb)
This project utilizes Python to generate data visualizations on data extracted from the web. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to visualize trends, and patterns in data. The datasets explored in this project included immigration data from the United Nation's website and vacation rental data from the city of New Orleans' website. This project outlines the use of the following visualizations to explore data trends and insights, line plots, area plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots, bubble plots and maps.
